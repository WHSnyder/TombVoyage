# TombVoyage

This is more of a scene than a game.  I wanted to create some kind of Star Wars inspired sequence where the player explores a tomb carved into a large asteroid.  
<br><br>
The player can throw asteroids around telekinetically and controls the spacecraft with a virtual joystick.  I wanted to include dynamic destruction for collisions between asteroids but that appeared to be a seriously deep rabbit hole.  School started back up and I had to abandon this for a while. 

<br><br>

Maybe I'll update this to include some particle system effects with dust and prefabbed asteroid chunks to fake an accurate collision after school calms down...
